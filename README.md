# Quizzie

Quizzie is a simple web application that allows you to **create** and share quizzes.
Jump into the app and play public quizzes instantly — no account needed 🪄

If you want to test the editor and are not logged in, the quiz you create will be saved locally in your browser and uploaded to your account once you login 😌. However, having an account allows you to create multiple quizzes and share them with others.

Complete the quiz and see your score at the end, if you got at least 2 stars out of 3, confetti will be thrown at you to celebrate your achievement 🎉
